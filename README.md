# Teras
Teras is a fighting pokemon like game, made for my intro to python class.

Welcome to the readme file of Teras! This game was made my freshman year fall semester as my final project for my python class, we had to use a very basic graphics library to make it, plus I didn't have a lot of experience coding. Feel free to play with the game and mess with the code.

How to set up:
Download John Zelle's graphics packet
Download the file called essentialfiles from the github and put it in the same directory as the graphics packet.
Put the .py file in that directory as well
ENJOY!
